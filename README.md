# Wine_Quality_Prediction
This project aims to predict the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The quality of wine is a crucial factor for both producers and consumers. By leveraging machine learning models, we can build a system that can predict wine quality based on various attributes, enabling winemakers to produce better wines and customers to make more informed choices.

The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of wine samples along with their respective quality ratings. The attributes include features such as acidity, pH, residual sugar, alcohol content, and more. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.
Linear Regression is used for modelling and prediction.
